    Owner of the "Winterbeard's Sigil".
    Alkregg Winterbeard was Astrid's father and was a brilliant host. He provided unique shows and delicious banquets to weary and downcast travelers.
    Upon his death, the Tavern passed into the hands of his beloved daughter. Without knowing how to generate the same joy as his father.
    She went through difficult times, with the imminent collapse of her father's legacy, she restructured everything, now she does not seek to be or act like her beloved father, she would follow his path in life and manage the tavern they loved so much.
    Thanks to this change of thought, Astrid met her current best friend, Vadanna, and old Loogandril.
