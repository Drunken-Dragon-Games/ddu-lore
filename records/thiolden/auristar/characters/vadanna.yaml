    Belonging to a group of jugglers and trapeze artists in the Auristar circus, Vadanna suffered an injury that diminished his ability and eventually led to his expulsion from the Circus. With no money and no hope, despair washed over her.
    Finally, Vadanna reached for the Seal of Winterbeard. On his first night, he found Astrid trying to serve beer while waiting tables, preparing food, and trying to make an entertaining scene with juggling. During this chaos, Astrid tripped and knocked over the beers she was carrying to customers, they reacted violently and the music suddenly stopped.
    Without thinking, Vadanna took a mug full of beer, placed it on her head, and began to dance around the tavern while singing happily, the attention was completely directed to Vadanna, and the attacked customers ended up mesmerized by the songs and movements of Vadanna. Vadanna, They completely forgot about the incident.
    In the end, the tavern was filled with noise between applause and shouts for the spectacle they had just seen. Thus began the relationship between Astrid and Vadanna, who from that day on began working together on the Sigil of Winterbeard, gradually returning it to its former glory.
