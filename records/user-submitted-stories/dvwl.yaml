- topic: Aki's day off
  needsReview: true
  facts: |
  Aki, Vilkyr from the East, a proud warrior from a distant land. She had traveled far and wide, battling fierce monsters and vanquishing evil wherever she went. But today was her day off, and she was determined to enjoy it to the fullest.
  She woke up early, feeling refreshed and rejuvenated. After stretching and practicing her sword techniques for a few hours, she decided to take a stroll through the forest with her animal companion, Fubuki.
  Fubuki is a <insert animal species here>, with fur as golden as the autumn foliage and eyes that shone like stars. He was Aki's closest ally and trusted friend, always ready to join her on any adventure.
  As they walked through the forest, Aki couldn't help but feel a sense of joy and wonder. The trees rustled in the gentle breeze, and the sun filtered through the leaves, casting a warm glow over everything. She breathed in the crisp, clean air and felt her spirits lift.
  After a while, they came to a clearing where a small stream flowed. Aki sat down on a rock and watched as Fubuki sniffed around, exploring the area. She closed her eyes and basked in the peace and quiet of the forest.
  Suddenly, Fubuki let out a low-pitched growl, and Aki's eyes snapped open. She stood up, hand on her sword, ready for any danger. But as she scanned the area, she saw nothing out of the ordinary.
  Fubuki trotted over to her and peck her hand, letting out a soft hoot. Aki realized that her companion was simply trying to tell her that it was time to head back.
  With a smile, Aki patted Fubuki on the head and they set off back through the forest. As they walked, Aki couldn't help but feel grateful for the simple pleasures of life, and the wonderful friends she had made along the way.

- topic: Aztuneio's deeds
  facts: |
  Terrorhertz and Vimtyr were sitting by the fire in Winterbeard's Sigil, enjoying a drink and listening to some music. Suddenly, Terrorhertz started telling Vimtyr an exciting story.
  "Listen up, Vimtyr," he said. "I have a tale to tell you about the great adventurer, Aztuneio, Ally of Beasts. She was a fearless ranger who traveled the land in search of new and exciting quests."
  Vimtyr leaned forward, his interest piqued. "Tell me more," he said.
  "Well, one day, Aztuneio heard about a powerful artifact that was hidden deep within a dungeon, guarded by a fierce dragon. She knew that she had to get her hands on that artifact, no matter what the cost," Terrorhertz continued.
  "But how did she defeat the dragon?" Vimtyr asked.
  Terrorhertz chuckled. "Ah, that's the best part. Aztuneio didn't defeat the dragon. She befriended it!" he said.
  Vimtyr looked at Terrorhertz incredulously. "How did she manage that?"
  "Aztuneio had a way with animals," Terrorhertz explained. "He knew that the dragon wasn't evil, just misunderstood. So, she approached it with respect and kindness, and after a bit of conversation, they became friends. The dragon even helped her get the artifact she was after."
  Vimtyr shook his head in disbelief. "That's an incredible story," he said. "Aztuneio must have been a truly remarkable adventurer."
  "She was," Terrorhertz agreed. "And that's why we need more adventurers like her. Brave, kind, and willing to take on any challenge. That's what the Drunken Dragon is all about."
  As Terrorhertz finished his story, Aztuneio, sitting at a corner just out of their sights, smiled, happy to hear that her deeds were being shared with others. She raised her glass to toast to the beasts of Thiolden and the friendship of the group.
  As the night went on, more and more adventurers joined the conversation, sharing their own stories of bravery and adventure. Terrorhertz and Vimtyr listened with rapt attention, feeling inspired and energized by the tales of their fellow travelers.
  In the end, they both knew that they were exactly where they were meant to be - at Winterbeard's Sigil, surrounded by like-minded adventurers, and ready to take on whatever challenge came their way.

- topic: Bodica's herb quest
  facts: |
  In the land of Thiolden, there was a great need for new and powerful medicines to heal the sick and injured. The kingdoms had long been at war with neighboring lands and the constant battles had left many wounded and ill. The then leader of Nurmyr, Ude Namvar, who held onto the epithet, Speaker of the Forest, desperate to find a solution, put out a call to all the land's greatest adventurers, scholars, and healers to come forth and aid in the search for new medicinal plants.
  One such adventurer was a young druid named Bodica. This was from time many moons ago. She had always been fascinated by the healing properties of plants and had spent many years studying the natural world in search of new remedies. When she heard the call of the Ude, she knew that this was her chance to make a real difference and set out on a quest to find the rarest and most powerful plants in all the land.
  Bodica journeyed deep into the heart of the Virnayen's dense forests, climbing treacherous mountains, and crossing raging rivers in search of her quarry. For many months she traveled, facing countless dangers and overcoming countless obstacles, but she never gave up. Finally, she came upon a hidden valley where she discovered a rare and exotic plant unlike anything she had ever seen before.
  The plant was tall and green, with delicate purple flowers that seemed to glow in the sunlight. Bodica knew that this was the plant she had been searching for and she carefully harvested a few samples, taking great care to preserve their potency.
  She brought the samples back to Nurmyr and set to work studying their medicinal properties. She found that the plant had powerful healing properties and could be used to treat everything from minor cuts and bruises to serious wounds and diseases. Ude was overjoyed when he heard the news and ordered that the plant be grown and harvested in large quantities so that it could be distributed to the people of the land.
  And so, Bodica's quest was a success. Her discovery brought hope to the people of Nurmyr and brought an end to the suffering of many. She was hailed as a hero and her name was remembered in the annals of history as the one who had saved the Nurmyr from certain doom. 
  Thanks to this act or so the story goes, she unanimously became the leader of Nurmyr. What other acts of unconditional love Bodica performed is a story for next time.

- topic: Eify's legends
  facts: |
  Eify, a bard from the bustling city far south who came to the Royal Academy of Oxinton at the School of Arts and Music in Exeter, had always been fascinated by tales of great Vilkyr (Free Sword in the Old Norsund) and their deeds. One night, while enjoying a pint of ale at a local tavern, Eify struck up a conversation with an old traveling bard named Othil. Othil regaled Eify with stories of brave warriors, powerful magi, and cunning thieves, each one more incredible than the last. Eify knew then and there that he had to document and preserve these stories for future generations to enjoy.
  And so, Eify, having heard songs and read tales of the brave Vilkyr fascinated him to the point of dropping school and becoming one, set out on a journey to far-flung corners of the world, seeking out adventurers who had their own tales of bravery and valor to share. He traveled through dark forests, treacherous mountains, and scorching deserts, always on the lookout for those who had something to add to his collection of stories.
  Eify met many brave and honorable warriors, each with their own tale of overcoming insurmountable odds to save their people. He also met powerful wizards and warlocks who had harnessed the very forces of nature to defeat their foes. And cunning thieves who had outwitted their enemies and made off with unimaginable treasures.
  As Eify gathered these stories and shared them with others, he helped to spread the legend of these heroes and inspire others to follow in their footsteps. He became known as the "Darkstar", and his tales were passed down through the generations, becoming a part of the fabric of the world itself.
  Eify's journey was long and treacherous, but he knew that it was worth it to have been able to preserve these stories for all time. And in the end, Eify knew that he too had become a legend, the bard who had set out to document the stories of great heroes and succeeded. The best songs come from his own "heroic" feats with his own extravagant fashion and performance style.

- topic: Gulnim failed heist
  facts: |
  Gulnim sat at his usual table in the dimly lit tavern, nursing a steaming cup of black tea as he waited for his contact to arrive. He was the Black Market Supplier for the Thieves Guild, a shadowy organization that operated in the shadows of the city. His job was to acquire and distribute all manner of illegal goods to the guild's members, from stolen jewels to rare magical artifacts.
  But today's supply deal had not gone as planned. He had arranged to meet with a wealthy merchant who was rumored to have a collection of rare, enchanted weapons hidden in his private vault. Gulnim had hoped to acquire some of these weapons for the guild, but the merchant had double-crossed him, summoning a group of armed guards to seize the illegal goods and arrest Gulnim and his associates.
  Gulnim had managed to escape, but he knew that the guild would not be pleased with the outcome of the deal. He would have to report the failure to his superiors and face their anger and disappointment.
  As he waited for his contact, Gulnim sipped his tea and tried to come up with a plan to make amends for the botched deal. He had a reputation to uphold, and he couldn't afford to let this setback tarnish his name in the criminal underworld.
  Suddenly, the door to the tea shop swung open and a hooded figure entered, pulling back the hood to reveal a face that was all too familiar to Gulnim. It was the Guild Master of the Thieves Guild, a cunning and ruthless Vulkin known as Vale.
  "Gulnim," he said, his voice dripping with contempt. "I hear you've had a bit of a setback today."
  Gulnim nodded, his heart sinking as he realized that Vale had come to confront him about the failed deal. "I'm sorry, Vale," he said, bowing his head in shame. "I'll make it right, I swear."
  Vale waved his hand dismissively. "There's no time for apologies, Gulnim. I have a job for you, one that will require all of your skills and resourcefulness. A wealthy lord has acquired a valuable magical artifact, and I want it. I need you to retrieve it for me, no matter the cost."
  Gulnim nodded, knowing that he had no choice but to accept the mission. He was a member of the Thieves Guild, and he had a reputation to uphold. He would have to pull off the heist of his life and bring the artifact back to Vale, or face the consequences.
  As he listened to Vale's instructions, Gulnim knew that this would be no ordinary job. He would have to use all of his cunning and skill to outwit the lord and his guards, and he would have to be ready for anything.
  But he was Gulnim, the Black Market Supplier of the Thieves Guild, and he had never backed down from a challenge. He would succeed, or he would die trying.
  As he finished his tea and prepared to leave, Gulnim knew that this would be a night to remember, a night that would either make or break his reputation in the criminal underworld. But he was ready for whatever lay ahead, and he would not be denied.

- topic: Kilia's new song
  facts: |
  Kilia walked into Winterbeard's Sigil, tired from a long day of travel. The tavern was quiet, and she noticed Gadrull, Vadanna, and Astrid sitting together, discussing ways to attract more patrons.
  As Kilia approached the bar, Vadanna noticed her and said, "Welcome, Kilia. It's been a slow night, but we're hoping to come up with some ideas to bring in more customers."
  Kilia nodded and smiled, "I might be able to help with that," she said, "I was actually inspired by your conversation, and I've composed a new song for Winterbeard's Sigil."
  The other three looked at each other in surprise and curiosity. "Let's hear it," Astrid said eagerly.
  Kilia took a deep breath and began to play her lute. Her voice was clear and strong, filling the quiet tavern with beautiful music.
  "Come gather 'round all ye travelers near and far
  To Winterbeard's Sigil, where ale is in a jar
  The fire's warm, the ale is cool
  And the stories told are never dull
  The finest drinks you'll find in the land
  Served by the kindest of all hands
  Come drink with us, and stay awhile
  And share your tales mile after mile"
  As Kilia finished her song, the group at the bar clapped and cheered, impressed by her beautiful voice and the catchy melody of her song.
  "That was amazing, Kilia!" Vadanna said excitedly. "We have to add that to our regular repertoire."
  Kilia smiled, "I'd be happy to play it every time I visit. I think it captures the warmth and hospitality of Winterbeard's Sigil perfectly."
  And from that night on, every time Kilia visited the tavern, she would sing her song, inviting new patrons to come and experience the hospitality of Winterbeard's Sigil.

- topic: Ulf's artifact
  facts: |
  The young and ambitious adventurers (GMA#2763, an Elenidas Elf Fighter and GMA#2913, a Cov Human Cleric), eager for fame and fortune, gathered at Winterbeard's Sigil, a local tavern known for its legendary quests. As they sat at the bar, sipping ale and swapping tales of adventure, a mysterious figure approached them with a proposition.
  The figure, an aged mage known as Ulf, Magi of the Seven Lights of Auristar, who that very night, somehow managed to sneak away the King's guards that followed him day-in, day-out, for he is the most trusted advisor to the King, offered them a quest to retrieve a valuable and powerful magical artifact known as the "Heart of the Rabbit." The artifact was said to grant immense power and wealth to whoever possessed it, and Ulf was willing to pay a handsome reward for its safe return.
  Without hesitation, the adventurers accepted the quest and set out on their journey. As they traveled through the rugged mountains and dense forests, they encountered a variety of challenges and dangers. They fought fierce monsters, braved treacherous terrain, and outsmarted rival adventurers who sought the artifact for themselves.
  But the journey was not without its struggles. The adventurers faced internal conflicts and doubts as they struggled with trust and unity. But through determination and perseverance, they emerged victorious and returned home as heroes.
  Upon their return, they presented the Heart of the Rabbit to Ulf at the Auristar's Magi Trainhall, who was overjoyed with their success. He bestowed upon them a great sum of gold and treasures, and their names were forever etched into the annals of history as the brave warriors who retrieved the Heart of the Rabbit.
  The young and ambitious adventurers, now seasoned grandmaster adventurers, set out on new and even more dangerous quests, always seeking to test their limits and prove their worth. 
  That night, they went back to Winterbeard's Sigil, with a heroes welcome. But they would always remember the journey that made them heroes, and the powerful artifact that started it all, the Heart of the Rabbit.
  As a final note, the Heart of the Rabbit was not just an ordinary artifact, it was said to contain the soul of a ancient rabbit that was defeated and sealed inside the heart. We all know that rabbits only lived up to 12 human years but this particular one had been around for centuries. The artifact was said to grant immense power to whoever possessed it because it was said to allow the wielder to tap into the rabbit's power and wisdom. It's said that the rabbit's power was so immense that it could grant immortality, control over elemental forces, and even the ability to manipulate aether. The artifact was also said to be highly sought after by powerful wizards, sorcerers, and even kings.
  What is Ulf up to, you say, is a story for another time.
