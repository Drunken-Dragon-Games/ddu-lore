  facts: |
  The night was fresh, light was cast onto the street as three figures left the Winterbeard’s Sigil. One tall and slender, the other small but stout and the last one walking on all fours.
  “Taverns full of tales about the chronicler, Arandel. You sure this maniac can help us decrypt those rune slates?”, the dwarf asked his elven friend.
  “Far from certain, Thogrim old friend. Though Sorania here thinks it’s a good idea to seek him out regardless. And when has she ever led us astray?”
  “I still don’t get how you converse with this silver wolf, and she led us astray more times than you’d like to admit. Anyhow, let’s get going and find this man, there is nothing left to do here anyways.” 
  Thus, our party got going, recounting the strange tales they had heard in the evening. This scholar of madness was an intriguing figure, said to know tales from the ancient of times and modern song alike. Some even whisper that he is a seer as well, dreaming of events that have been, are or are yet to be in his disturbed sleep.1
  As our trio walked amongst the city the dwarf could be heard laughing heartily.“Ridiculous I say! Corpses I’d understand but toenails?! Which lunatic would take those as payment? Come on Arandel, tell me the lad was drunk when he said it. This must be a sick joke no one would take those!”
  “Clippings of toenails. And these are the words of Eify. I am afraid to disappoint he was very much sober, said being inebriated would impact his performance. He saw them being traded away behind the tavern, thinks some warlock did buy them, though he does not know the seller. Anyhow What’s the worst you’ve heard tonight my friend?”²
  “Pfft, nothing can beat that nonsense. There was talk about some potato miracle in a village half a days journey from here.³ Oh ah yes, this black market peddler Vlago, Vlogan, Volggan or somesuch seemed pretty embarrassed. Though I coaxed it out of the poor sod, apparently someone else was looking for our wise man, and well did something rather unspoken of.”
  “Such as..?”, the elf prompted his companion to go on.
  “Cutting a dwarf’s beard! Well I bought him a round and told him I wouldn’t utter another word about it. You know common courtesy between people.”
  “Someone rubbed him behind his ears right?”4
  “How do you know these things?!”, a shocked Thogrim asked his elven friend.
  “Thogrim, Thogrim, you forget we are travelling in the company of Sorania.” Arandel said as he patted the wolf’s head.
  “Oh right… How long have you two been travelling together? And how come you are allowed to do this?”
  Just as Arandel wanted to answer this question, the three were interrupted by one of the city guard.
  “What are you looking for here in the second ring at this hour of the night?”
  “Ah fair lady, we are but simply on a quest to find the chronicler.” Thogrim answered.
  “The old man? Just don’t carry any open flame into his abode. Why do you seek him out?”
  “Oh well you see, there is this rune slate we found, and we hope he might be able to decipher it for us. The tongue is old and we could only make out a few words myself. You see this…” the dwarf started to explain as he was cut off by guard. “I’ll have you know that rune magic is forbidden in this city! Explain yourself at once!”
  “My lady, what my companion here wanted to say, is that the slate is not magical, the runes are just the written word of the people alive at that time. We heard the chronicler mumble something about saltwater granting strength and power, so we thought he might be able to read the merfolk tongue. At the very least he will be interested in studying it.” Arandel interjected.
  “That old story. I must inform you ingesting saltwater does not grant you any strength or power at all, at best you start puking your guts out. Forgive my harshness, it’s just we had some terrible experience with rune magic and thus it was forbidden.”5
  “Let me guess, some fool caused a cataclysmic explosion of power putting them too close to each other to safe on magical infused material or? Tsk. beginner mistakes, let me tell you rune magic is a dangerous craft for those not understanding the forces involved. It’s better you humans leave it alone, the consequences are not worth the benefits” the dwarf replied.
  “What do you know of rune magic?!” the knight demanded answer of Thogrim.
  “Me personally, little at all, I know that our ancestors were well versed in it, built cities underneath mountains we are unable to replicate. There are others more knowledgeable in this craft, I just know that the novice better have a good master else, he spells his own doom. You see I am soldier first and merchant second, I ain’t no runesmith. Never had the brains to understand half the arcane formulae required to even infuse my first one. But coin, that I do understand.”
  “I see, well in this case pray continue on your quest, or do you need help finding the chroniclers dwelling?”
  “We would be delighted to be travelling in your company. Pray forgive me, but I did not catch your name before fair lady.” Arandel sought to reconcile with the guard.
  “Marendil. It is not far, let me show you the way.”
  And so the search continued, along the way they talked about a plethora of topics, the past adventures of Arandel and Thogrim, the life in Auristar, history and much more.
  It was not long before our heroes approached an old house nearby an illuminated pond. Without hesitation Marendil opened the squeaking door and lead our party inside.
  There they found rooms filled with shelfs and other storage filled to the brim with scrolls, parchments, books and other written works. Even the one or the other stone slate poked through this chaotic collection. At the end of this maze of knowledge, in a quaint little study they found the person they were looking for. Slumped over his desk, there he was. The Chronicler.
  “Welcome in my humble abode, how may I help you?” a tired old man asked the adventurers.
  “Mr. Chronicler I bring before you, Thogrim, Arandel and this here silver wolf I think they said is called Sorania.” Marendil introduced the party.
  “A silver wolf? Marendil consider yourself lucky, they have been extinct in Thiolden for many aeons now. I heard stories that some elven folk had silver wolf cavalry, though I never dared dream to see one myself. They are loyal and intelligent companions. So I take it you come from far away Thogrim and Arandel.”
  “Yes Mr. Chronicler was it? I thought you would have a name.” Arandel responded.
  “I have plenty of names amongst the townsfolk, but Chronicler should do fine for now. Tell me one does not travel from outside Thiolden to Auristar just to see the world. Why have you come here?”
  “Well actually he does” Thogrim replied, “Arandel is known as the wandering scholar, striving to learn as much from the world as he can. However, you are right, we did not venture forth simply on a mere quest for knowledge. We heard of a wise man, versed in the different tongue of empires long forgotten, we followed the stories and the closer to Thiolden we got the more numerous the rumours got.”
  As Thogrim recounted the tales of their journey, Arandel unpacked the rune slate and placed it on the desk. The eyes of the chronicler widened…
  “Impossible, it can not be. Merfolk runes.” he exhaled “Where did you get this from? Do you know where they live now or what happened to them?”
  “Thogrim found this amongst his family heirlooms. We do not, we thought maybe you could help us decipher, the little I could make out leads me to believe, that should they still exist this slate here would point us to were they last set up residence.” the elf explained.
  “By the lights! This is most interesting news, all I know is a story about some people that drank the water of the sea before castings powerful magic, as if commanding the elements themselves. Could it be?..”
  “That sounds like old folktales I have heard. Do you know something about a siren’s song? It is said that merfolk song could conjure up realities of different kind. To guide home lost sailors or sink threats to their homes.” Arandel remarked.
  This seemed to remind the chronicler of something. “Excuse me, but would you be up for another adventure? You see there is this story about an old merfolk relic, I have an idea were it may lay buried. Alas my bones are old, my heart is weary, so I wonder if instead of me you three could go?”

  Century old dust stirred into motion as the chronicler rushed to find the source of this accursed smell. Does the youth have no manners anymore? No respect for his profession? he asked himself as he paced towards the entrance.
  His eyes widened in horror! “You Fool!”, the old one exclaimed as he rushed to meet the stranger. “Put it out! This is no place for tomfoolery!”, the madman spouted as he shoved the perplexed young lad against the wall skilfully maneuvering the newcomers hand into a barrel full of stale water.
  “Wha…” “Shush, look at what you have done!” he harshly interrupted the visitor holding aloft a singed piece of cloth. “These could have been the answers you are looking for! Welcome to the largest hoard of written chronicles this side of the pond. Remember! No flames! No fire!”

- topic: The Name
  facts: |
  The door creaked as it was pushed open, revealing a room filled to the brim with old scriptures, scrolls and books. A young girl entered cautiously calling out for the master of this abode. “Mister Chronicler! Are you there?”, the quiet voice pierced the silence.
  “Yes! Yes! What do you need?” the old man responded as he walked to the entrance.
  “I was wondering Sir, if you could let me know…” “Well yes of course my dear! What is it you need? A recipe for eternal youth? I have several dozen here. I am afraid they do not seem work. At least those I managed to try…”, the man said as he rummaged through the shelves.
  The visitor interrupted: “No sir, nothing complicated like that. Instead, I am just curious what is your name?” “Ah yes of course no problem. There it is! This one should work.”, the chronicler answered as he handed her a scroll.
  Confused she took it from his hands. “What should work?” “This love potion of course! That’s why you came here young lady. Well just follow the instructions and soon you’ll be in the arms of your lover. Have a nice day.”, he said and turned to return to his work.
  Baffled the girl mumbled a “Thank you” as she left thinking about this strange encounter with the old man.

- topic: Tavern Talks 1
  facts: |
  “What?! NO!” a shrill voice pierced the heavy air. “It was nothing like that!” could be heard before a tankard slammed a table. Three people could be seen debating around this table, ignoring the sounds of the tavern around them.
  “I tell you…” the short-tempered woman started before being interrupted by a deep grovelling voice. “Enough! I do not care about the antics of the old fool, important is what he told you. What has he told you about the flame of west?”
  “He told me much about this and that, though little about the flame of the west. Kept always on mumbling about my demise if I dared venture forth on that quest. Said it be best if old relics were left undisturbed.” the woman answered. “I am not sure of this, maybe I should look for better coin elsewhere, something easier, less risk.”
  “And leave us alone?! Are you seriously scared about the mumblings of this mad man?”
  “Not just his mumblings, also the written works he handed me. See for yourself and leave me out of this mess!” she said and dumped a bag full of parchments on the table.

- topic: Tavern Visit
  facts: |
  Lightning illuminated the hooded figure in the entrance as it stepped inside. The tavern fell silent, all eyes stared at the doorway. Murmurs could be heard as the ominous newcomer shed his mantle moving straight towards an empty table.
  “Could it be? But why? The chronicler?”
  The moment someone dared utter the name, the tavern was cast into darkness as torches were extinguished through an unknown force. In the following silence only the rain, hammering roof and windows, and the recital of arcane formulae could be heard.
  And as quick as the light was out, the rooms were lit again by blue ethereal light. The table no longer empty as a mage and the chronicler sat down. A curious student brought over three tankards of ale.
  “Mind if I joined you? First round is on me!”, she said whilst grabbing an empty stool.

- topic: The Canibalmanac
  facts: |
  It was this time of year again, the night longer than any other. The rain was hounding the city again.
  During these nights it is said, that ghosts could cross the border into the lands of the living.
  All was quiet in the chronicler's abode. The quills rested and the old man sleeping. However down in the cellar, past the furthest corner this silence would be disturbed. As a shelf came crashing down, it's rotting boards no longer able to hold the weight of the knowledge within.
  Spiders scurried into the darkest cracks as dusty figures were cast into the shadows.
  The air stale and humid came to a rest once more. Scattered amongst the books and tomes, scrolls and parchment was a leatherbound almanac, immaculate compared to waterlogged and mouldy works around it and when you watched carefully this book would appear to be gaining pages as others disappeared.
  In the morning though nothing out of the ordinary would be discovered except a storage failure.
  During the clean up one scribe would remark at how perfect this single tome looked, and how much heavier it seemed to be compared to the previous year. But nothing will come of these observations as every year it was the same and next year a shelf will fail again.
  In those nights some swear the chronicler is mumbling in his sleep. "The stories, they are alive."

- topic: The Quarrel
  facts: |
  The calm of the morning was disturbed by heated discussion. All night long something unusual was going in the chronicler’s abode. A clash of emotions against reason, a jousting of words.
  “Burn them?! Have you lost your mind, to your fanatic stupor?! This knowledge very well prove useful once more! What will you do when the city is threatened from outside and not within? Send out envoys to uncover the lost arts? Madness! I say! These records, dangerous as they may be, are staying here!”, the chronicler lectured his visitor.
  “Madness? You do not seem to understand old fool, that it was the practise of this kind of magic that wiped our entire city clean of the map! This is a terrible gamble you propose here, have you not learned a thing of the past?! Destroy it! Rid the world of such danger!”, the magus retorted.
  “A fool?! You think me a fool, yet you ignore we are not the only ones capable of this! Have you forgotten that it was dwarves that first tough us these arts? That we came across many different cultures practising it in their own way and form? We are not the first and definitely not the last society employing this way of manipulating the world around us. Leave! Before you spout any more nonsense. Leave! Before words are spoken, that are better left unspoken.”, the old one demanded.
  “This is not the last word on that matter! The council will hear of your insubordination!”, enraged the magus shouted as he threw open the door.
  Gently it was closed, to return the calm of the morning after heated debate.
