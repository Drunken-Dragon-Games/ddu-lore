  The night was fresh, light was cast onto the street as three figures left the Winterbeard’s Sigil. One tall and slender, the other small but stout and the last one walking on all fours.
  “Taverns full of tales about the chronicler, Arandel. You sure this maniac can help us decrypt those rune slates?”, the dwarf asked his elven friend.
  “Far from certain, Thogrim old friend. Though Sorania here thinks it’s a good idea to seek him out regardless. And when has she ever led us astray?”
  “I still don’t get how you converse with this silver wolf, and she led us astray more times than you’d like to admit. Anyhow, let’s get going and find this man, there is nothing left to do here anyways.” 
  Thus, our party got going, recounting the strange tales they had heard in the evening. This scholar of madness was an intriguing figure, said to know tales from the ancient of times and modern song alike. Some even whisper that he is a seer as well, dreaming of events that have been, are or are yet to be in his disturbed sleep.1
  As our trio walked amongst the city the dwarf could be heard laughing heartily.“Ridiculous I say! Corpses I’d understand but toenails?! Which lunatic would take those as payment? Come on Arandel, tell me the lad was drunk when he said it. This must be a sick joke no one would take those!”
  “Clippings of toenails. And these are the words of Eify. I am afraid to disappoint he was very much sober, said being inebriated would impact his performance. He saw them being traded away behind the tavern, thinks some warlock did buy them, though he does not know the seller. Anyhow What’s the worst you’ve heard tonight my friend?”²
  “Pfft, nothing can beat that nonsense. There was talk about some potato miracle in a village half a days journey from here.³ Oh ah yes, this black market peddler Vlago, Vlogan, Volggan or somesuch seemed pretty embarrassed. Though I coaxed it out of the poor sod, apparently someone else was looking for our wise man, and well did something rather unspoken of.”
  “Such as..?”, the elf prompted his companion to go on.
  “Cutting a dwarf’s beard! Well I bought him a round and told him I wouldn’t utter another word about it. You know common courtesy between people.”
  “Someone rubbed him behind his ears right?”4
  “How do you know these things?!”, a shocked Thogrim asked his elven friend.
  “Thogrim, Thogrim, you forget we are travelling in the company of Sorania.” Arandel said as he patted the wolf’s head.
  “Oh right… How long have you two been travelling together? And how come you are allowed to do this?”
  Just as Arandel wanted to answer this question, the three were interrupted by one of the city guard.
  “What are you looking for here in the second ring at this hour of the night?”
  “Ah fair lady, we are but simply on a quest to find the chronicler.” Thogrim answered.
  “The old man? Just don’t carry any open flame into his abode. Why do you seek him out?”
  “Oh well you see, there is this rune slate we found, and we hope he might be able to decipher it for us. The tongue is old and we could only make out a few words myself. You see this…” the dwarf started to explain as he was cut off by guard. “I’ll have you know that rune magic is forbidden in this city! Explain yourself at once!”
  “My lady, what my companion here wanted to say, is that the slate is not magical, the runes are just the written word of the people alive at that time. We heard the chronicler mumble something about saltwater granting strength and power, so we thought he might be able to read the merfolk tongue. At the very least he will be interested in studying it.” Arandel interjected.
  “That old story. I must inform you ingesting saltwater does not grant you any strength or power at all, at best you start puking your guts out. Forgive my harshness, it’s just we had some terrible experience with rune magic and thus it was forbidden.”5
  “Let me guess, some fool caused a cataclysmic explosion of power putting them too close to each other to safe on magical infused material or? Tsk. beginner mistakes, let me tell you rune magic is a dangerous craft for those not understanding the forces involved. It’s better you humans leave it alone, the consequences are not worth the benefits” the dwarf replied.
  “What do you know of rune magic?!” the knight demanded answer of Thogrim.
  “Me personally, little at all, I know that our ancestors were well versed in it, built cities underneath mountains we are unable to replicate. There are others more knowledgeable in this craft, I just know that the novice better have a good master else, he spells his own doom. You see I am soldier first and merchant second, I ain’t no runesmith. Never had the brains to understand half the arcane formulae required to even infuse my first one. But coin, that I do understand.”
  “I see, well in this case pray continue on your quest, or do you need help finding the chroniclers dwelling?”
  “We would be delighted to be travelling in your company. Pray forgive me, but I did not catch your name before fair lady.” Arandel sought to reconcile with the guard.
  “Marendil. It is not far, let me show you the way.”
  And so the search continued, along the way they talked about a plethora of topics, the past adventures of Arandel and Thogrim, the life in Auristar, history and much more.
  It was not long before our heroes approached an old house nearby an illuminated pond. Without hesitation Marendil opened the squeaking door and lead our party inside.
  There they found rooms filled with shelfs and other storage filled to the brim with scrolls, parchments, books and other written works. Even the one or the other stone slate poked through this chaotic collection. At the end of this maze of knowledge, in a quaint little study they found the person they were looking for. Slumped over his desk, there he was. The Chronicler.
  “Welcome in my humble abode, how may I help you?” a tired old man asked the adventurers.
  “Mr. Chronicler I bring before you, Thogrim, Arandel and this here silver wolf I think they said is called Sorania.” Marendil introduced the party.
  “A silver wolf? Marendil consider yourself lucky, they have been extinct in Thiolden for many aeons now. I heard stories that some elven folk had silver wolf cavalry, though I never dared dream to see one myself. They are loyal and intelligent companions. So I take it you come from far away Thogrim and Arandel.”
  “Yes Mr. Chronicler was it? I thought you would have a name.” Arandel responded.
  “I have plenty of names amongst the townsfolk, but Chronicler should do fine for now. Tell me one does not travel from outside Thiolden to Auristar just to see the world. Why have you come here?”
  “Well actually he does” Thogrim replied, “Arandel is known as the wandering scholar, striving to learn as much from the world as he can. However, you are right, we did not venture forth simply on a mere quest for knowledge. We heard of a wise man, versed in the different tongue of empires long forgotten, we followed the stories and the closer to Thiolden we got the more numerous the rumours got.”
  As Thogrim recounted the tales of their journey, Arandel unpacked the rune slate and placed it on the desk. The eyes of the chronicler widened…
  “Impossible, it can not be. Merfolk runes.” he exhaled “Where did you get this from? Do you know where they live now or what happened to them?”
  “Thogrim found this amongst his family heirlooms. We do not, we thought maybe you could help us decipher, the little I could make out leads me to believe, that should they still exist this slate here would point us to were they last set up residence.” the elf explained.
  “By the lights! This is most interesting news, all I know is a story about some people that drank the water of the sea before castings powerful magic, as if commanding the elements themselves. Could it be?..”
  “That sounds like old folktales I have heard. Do you know something about a siren’s song? It is said that merfolk song could conjure up realities of different kind. To guide home lost sailors or sink threats to their homes.” Arandel remarked.
  This seemed to remind the chronicler of something. “Excuse me, but would you be up for another adventure? You see there is this story about an old merfolk relic, I have an idea were it may lay buried. Alas my bones are old, my heart is weary, so I wonder if instead of me you three could go?”
