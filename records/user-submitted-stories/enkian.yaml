  Come with me my friends as we journey north to the isle of Farheim. A land near and dear to many of our hearts. A land filled with wonder, merriment and bitter rivalries. A land that is home to the fabled Drunken Dragon. Founded by the great adventurer Vledic, the Drunken Dragon is a place of camaraderie and respite for heroes and explorers, both old and new alike. 
  It was a cool Friday evening in early Autumn and many warriors, wizards and friends had gathered in the Drunken Dragon to warm themselves by the hearth with a belly full of the sweetest ale and a meal fit for a king. 
  Vimtyr, the Whispering Axe, sat at a table by the bar gulping down his second mead of the evening. A quiet fellow, was Vimtyr, but he always enjoyed a tasty mead at the tavern.
  “That hits the spot,” he said, slamming his tankard onto the wooden table. “Barkeep, a third if you would be so kind.”
  The bartender sent a beautiful tavern maiden over with the mead, brewed with the finest honey in all of Farheim. It was very famous and Vimtyr’s favourite. His eyes widened as the mead was placed before him. It was a good day indeed.
  Suddenly, the door of the Drunken Dragon flung open and in walked a hunched figure. He was dressed in fine garments, but his face was as hairy as a monkey...for that was what he was. The figure strode towards the bar, clunking his quarterstaff on the floor with each step. Baboon, as he was known, was once a man, but cursed to take the form of a large monkey by a cunning witch. Baboon believed that the only way to break his curse was to become the richest man in the land. Only then would he be human, once again.
  “Good evening, ladies and gentlemen,” called out Baboon with a smug smirk. He glanced at Vimtyr, arm outreached and ready to grab his tankard.
  “I was hoping it would be a peaceful evening, Baboon,” said the Whispering Axe.
  “I assure you it will be,” chuckled the monkey man as reached the bar, ready to order a drink.
  The rest of the patrons of the Drunken Dragon were all on edge. When Vimtyr and Baboon were in the same room for longer than an hour, trouble usually brewed up. It is not known who started the rivalry between these two former friends, or acquaintances as I should say, for many tell different versions of the same story. I have my own version, but even I no longer know if it is truth.
  The evening continued peacefully for some time. Vimtyr quietly chugged his mead, making little conversation. Baboon sat in the corner playing games of chance with fellow patrons, usually coming out on top of the wagers.
  “Vimtyr, you seem quieter than usual today,” said Baboon, jaunting across the bar on all fours.
  Vimtyr sighed. “I have no time for your games today. You have made it clear many times that we are not friends, so let us remain strangers.”
  “I’m here to extend an olive branch,” said Baboon slyly. “Would you care for a drink? Your mead is running low.”
  Vimtyr raised an eyebrow suspiciously. “If you’re offering, it would be rude of me to turn it down. Thank you, Baboon.”
  “It is no trouble,” said Baboon as he sauntered off towards the bar.
  The Whispering Axe sat quietly, unsure of the monkey’s motive. Why was he being so friendly? Vledic would not return until tomorrow, so could it be that Baboon thought that he had free reign to cause mischief? Perhaps, he truly did want to make peace?
  A tavern maiden approached Vimtyr a short time later with a tankard. Baboon raised his own drink from across the bar, and Vimtyr raised his tankard back. The bandit took a sip of his drink and spat it out immediately.
  “Wine!” yelled Vimtyr. Never had he been so affronted. “You have caused trouble for the last time, Baboon.”
  Baboon laughed uproariously, flailing his long limbs about wildly and knocking food and drink to the floor. He only just had time to leap out of the way as a flying axe hurtled towards him and embedded itself in the wall.
  “Come now, Vimtyr,” he protested. “It was a joke! An aged peach wine for you to enjoy.”
  Vimtyr was in a rage and could not be reasoned with. He charged across the bar, another axe raised, while Baboon leapt to his feed, using his tail to whip his staff from the floor and into his hand.
  Vimtyr aimed to cut Baboon’s head clean from his body, but the monkey swiftly parried the strike with his staff.
  The patrons around the Drunken Dragon cleared the floor. Murmurs about this not being the time and place or what Vledic may think went unheard by Vimtyr and Baboon as they engaged in a ferocious duel.
  When Vimtyr swung his axe, Baboon would jab him in the stomach. When Baboon would strike at the head, Vimtyr would kick him aside. Tables were tossed across the tavern, bottles were smashed into a thousand tiny fragments, but the fight raged on.
  The Whispering Axe was hard on the offensive and backed Baboon onto the staircase, but the monkey thrust himself upwards with his staff and grabbed onto the second floor railing with his tail.
  “You can’t catch me,” grinned Baboon, dangling in front of the still-enraged Vimtyr.
  The bandit was usually strong-willed enough to resist being egged on, but not today. Vimtyr sprinted up the stairs while Baboon hurled himself onto the rafters, tossing copper coins at Vimtyr.
  “It was about time I showed you why they called me the Whispering Axe,” muttered Vimtyr, reaching for the axes he carried around his waist.
  One axe, two axes, three axes, they were flung with might through the air, making a soft whirring sound as they flew. One by one, Baboon dodged, but he started to look truly unnerved for the first time. Each axe was closer than the last, the third cutting a few hairs from the back of Baboon’s neck
  Sadly for all of us, Baboon could not resist taunting. He turned around, raised his cloak and waved his buttocks at Vimtyr. It was as red as Vimtyr’s face. Baboon scrambled down from the rafters and tossed himself through an open window and onto the roof below.
  Vimtyr was not to be deterred. He climbed out the window after his foe, and they continued their back-to-back blows. Baboon’s staff was notably shorter than when this fight began, but he would not back down. The patrons gathered outside and watched from the grass below as the rooftop duel only grew evermore wild.
  The bandit slashed a powerful slash, but Baboon cast it aside and knocked the axe to the ground. Vimtyr reached for another, but he was out. Most of his axes were firmly wedged in the walls of the Drunken Dragon.
  “Do you yield?” asked Baboon.
  Vimtyr yelled and charged at the monkey, tackling him off the roof. The pair tumbled through the air and crashed into a heap on the ground, but they would not stop. They punched and kicked, both weaponless, refusing to give into exhaustion, for it was exhausting indeed
  It was at this point that a bard extraordinaire emerged from the tavern. He was a handsome fellow wearing a blue jacket with a raven perched on his shoulder. He walked down the steps with his guitar raised. You know I’m speaking the truth, particularly the handsome part, because that bard was me.
  I began to play and a soothing tone spread throughout the air, captivating all who heard it. The melody was mellow, but it filled the area. Everyone from the gathered patrons to the squirrels in the trees listened intently.
  As my song filled their ears and their hearts, Vimtyr and Baboon fell limply. They finally caved to their exhaustion, but the song rejuvenated them at the same time. The fight was over and peace was returned to the Drunken Dragon.
  I wish I could tell you that the peace was forever, but even my songs are not that powerful, my friends. Baboon was sent away, not to return until the next day. Vimtyr, however, was approached by Vledic.
  “Vimtyr, my friend,” said Vledic, “I believe that you have a greater calling than to be involved in petty scraps with Baboon. You have the true heart of a warrior, we have all seen it. Behind that ferocious visage, there is a man who cares for the people. I urge you to travel to Thiolden. It is a land filled with great dangers and there are people there in need of your protection.”
  “Yes, Vledic,” replied the bandit. “I think that it is time. I shall do as you ask and make for Thiolden.”
  Vledic smiled. “I am pleased to hear this,” he said, “as the Drunken Dragon grows by the day. I expect you will not be the only adventurer travelling to Thiolden.”
  Vimtyr nodded. “I have no doubt that many new adventurers from the Drunken Dragon will want somewhere safe to set up their taverns. I will ensure that it is so.”
  And so Vimtyr began his journey. He travelled south to Thiolden, where nobody knew him, where he could become one with the woods. He was a blank slate here, but it did not take long for the name Whispering Axe to attach itself anew as his blades flung threw the air, slaying beasts aplenty. The only thing to follow him, aside from his name, was a monkey with a staff.
