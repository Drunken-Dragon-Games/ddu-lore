  facts: |
  Auristar Abbelka was a young vulkin who lived in the peaceful village of Thiolden. She was a skilled artist, known for her delicate and intricate prints. However, in Thiolden, it was strictly forbidden to create prints that depicted negative will or negative emotions.
  One day, a group of Kullmyr, a race of powerful and malevolent creatures, came to Thiolden in search of a skilled artist. They had heard of Auristar's talent and wanted her to create a print that would spread negative will throughout the village.
  Auristar, knowing the dangers of such a task, refused to comply. She knew that the Kullmyr were notorious for causing destruction and chaos wherever they went, and she didn't want to be a part of it.
  Despite her refusal, the Kullmyr persisted and began to threaten the safety of Auristar and her loved ones. Determined to protect her village and her family, Auristar made the difficult decision to flee into the magical forest that surrounded Thiolden.
  As she wandered deeper into the forest, Auristar encountered all sorts of strange and wondrous creatures. She met talking animals, glowing flowers, and even a group of friendly sprites.
  But the forest also held its dangers. Auristar encountered vicious beasts and dangerous predators, and she knew she had to be careful. As she continued on her journey, she began to feel lost and alone, wondering if she would ever find her way back home.
  Just when all hope seemed lost, Auristar stumbled upon a small child who was being attacked by a group of monsters. Without hesitation, Auristar used her quick thinking and artistic skills to distract the monsters and lead the child to safety.
  The child, who was lost and separated from her family, was grateful to Auristar for rescuing her. Together, they journeyed through the forest, facing challenges and making new friends along the way.
  Finally, after many days of traveling, Auristar and the child reached the edge of the forest and made their way back to Thiolden. The village was overjoyed to see Auristar safely returned, and the child was reunited with her family.
  From that day on, Auristar became known as a hero in Thiolden, and she continued to create beautiful and positive prints that brought joy and hope to the people of her village. And although she still sometimes thought of the magical forest and the adventures she had there, she knew that she had made the right decision in protecting her home and the people she loved.

  Eify: I can't believe you would do that without even consulting me first.
  Aumara: (sighs) I know. I'm sorry. But I was desperate.
  Eify: Desperate for what?  
  Aumara: (pauses, then speaks slowly) We've been working on this venture for years, and we're finally at a point where we can really make it take off. But we're still missing one key ingredient.
  Eify: (frowns) What are you talking about? 
  Aumara: (takes a deep breath) We need funding. A lot of it. And I know a guy named Gulnim who can help us get it. But he's got a lot of connections, and he's not easy to impress.
  Eify: (narrows his eyes) And you thought using our daughter to get his attention was the best way to do it?
  Aumara: (hesitates) It was the only way I could think of. I thought if he saw what a great family we are, he might be more likely to invest in us.
  Eify: (stands up and starts pacing) You can't just use our daughter like that. She's not some pawn to be manipulated.
  Aumara: (stands up, facing Eify) I know. And I'm sorry. But it's not like I'm asking her to do anything dangerous. Just show up at a few guild events. 
  Eify: (shakes his head) I can't believe you would even consider something like this. And who is this Gulnim guy?
  Aumara: (hesitates) He's a black market supplier for the Thieves Guild. He has a lot of connections and can get us the funding we need, but he's not exactly the most reputable person.
  Eify: (looks skeptical) And you think he's our best option?
  Aumara: (nods) It's not ideal, I know. But we've exhausted all of our other options. This is our last chance to get the funding we need.
  Eify: (pauses, then speaks slowly) I don't like it. But I guess I understand where you're coming from.
  Aumara: (relieved) Thank you. I promise, I'll do everything I can to make sure our daughter is safe. 
  Eify: (nods) I hope so. Because if anything happens to her, I'll never forgive you.
  (The scene ends as Eify and Aumara stand facing each other, both looking uncertain and tense.)

  Aumara sat at a table in the corner of the Drunken Dragon inn, staring at the piece of parchment in front of her. Eify stood across from her, his arms crossed and a scowl on his face.
  "How could you do this behind my back?" Eify said, his voice laced with anger. "You know how I feel about the black market."
  "I had to do something," Aumara replied, her voice calm but determined. "We've been getting more and more travellers coming through here, and with the increase in attacks from those creatures in the woods, we need to beef up our security to protect them. Gulnim was the only one who would lend us the money for hired help."
  Eify let out a frustrated sigh. "And what happens if we can't pay him back? You know how he operates. He'll ruin us."
  Aumara looked up at Eify, her eyes steady. "I'll make sure we can pay him back. And if we can't, I'll take responsibility for it. I won't let him hurt you or the inn. But more importantly, I won't let those creatures kill any more innocent travellers."
  There was a moment of silence as the two of them stared at each other, neither one backing down. Finally, Eify let out a sigh and sat down at the table.
  "Fine," he said. "But I'm coming with you when you meet with Gulnim. I want to hear his terms for myself."
  Aumara nodded and stood up, gathering the parchment and tucking it into her pocket. "I'll go find him now. Meet me at the entrance in an hour."
  Eify watched as Aumara left the inn, his mind racing with worry. He knew he couldn't stop her from going through with this, but he couldn't shake the feeling that something was going to go wrong.
  An hour later, Eify met Aumara at the entrance of the inn as promised. Together, they walked to the seedy part of town where Gulnim did most of his business.
  As they approached the door of a dingy storefront, Eify's nerves began to get the better of him. He turned to Aumara, his voice shaking slightly.
  "Are you sure about this?" he asked.
  Aumara gave him a reassuring smile. "I'm sure. Let's go see what Gulnim has to say."
  They walked into the storefront and were greeted by a thick cloud of smoke and the sound of laughter. In the corner, they saw Gulnim sitting at a table, surrounded by a group of rough-looking men.
  Aumara approached the table and cleared her throat, drawing Gulnim's attention.
  "Ah, Aumara," Gulnim said with a smile. "I was wondering when you'd come to see me. And who is this?" he asked, nodding towards Eify.
  "This is Eify," Aumara replied. "He's a partner in the inn."
  Gulnim chuckled. "Well, Eify, it seems you have quite the enterprising partner here. She's come to me with a proposition. Are you interested in hearing the terms?"
  Eify nodded, his mouth feeling dry. He knew this was the moment he had been dreading.
  Gulnim leaned back in his chair, a sly grin on his face. "The terms are simple. You pay me back
  Gulnim leaned back in his chair, a sly grin on his face. "The terms are simple. You pay me back the amount we agree upon, plus a generous interest fee, on the agreed upon date. Fail to do so, and I'll have to take drastic measures to recoup my investment. Do we have a deal?"
  Eify and Aumara exchanged a worried glance. They knew they had no choice but to agree to Gulnim's terms, but they also knew they couldn't afford to pay back the loan on time.
  Just as Eify was about to speak, Gulnim added a caveat to the deal.
  "Of course, there is one other thing I require," he said, his tone suggestive. "I've heard about your daughter's talents. I think she could be of great use to me in my business dealings."
  Aumara's eyes narrowed. "What are you suggesting?" she asked, her voice cold.
  Gulnim chuckled. "I'm just suggesting that if you can't pay me back on time, you could use your daughter's talents to make up the difference. It's a win-win situation for all of us."
  Eify felt his blood boil. He couldn't believe what he was hearing.
  "You can't be serious," he said, his voice shaking with anger. "We won't use our daughter like that."
  Gulnim shrugged. "Suit yourself. But if you can't pay me back on time, that's the only option you'll have."
  Eify and Aumara glared at Gulnim, their minds racing with fear and anger. They knew they were in a difficult position, and they didn't know what they were going to do.
  As they stood there, they noticed movement in the background. A few of Gulnim's men had shifted in their seats, their hands hovering near their weapons. It was a clear warning that if Eify and Aumara made an issue of things, there could be consequences.
  With heavy hearts, Eify and Aumara left the storefront and made their way back to the inn. They knew they had a difficult decision to make. They could try to come up with the money on their own and risk everything, or they could agree to Gulnim's terms and risk their daughter's safety. Either way, they knew they were in for a rough ride.
  Eify and Aumara glared at Gulnim, their minds racing with fear and anger. 
  Just as they were about to speak, Gulnim called them over to his table. He stood up from his seat and gestured for them to come closer.
  "I know this is a difficult situation," Gulnim said, his voice surprisingly compassionate. "But I promise you, I'll be fair. I just need to make sure my investment is secure. Do we have a deal?"
  Eify and Aumara nodded their heads in resignation, and Gulnim grinned triumphantly.
  "I knew you'd see reason," he said. "I'll have my man draw up the contract. You'll have it by tomorrow morning."
  Eify and Aumara followed Gulnim out of the storefront, their hearts heavy with dread. As they left, Gulnim saw them out personally, making sure to shake their hands and assure them that everything would work out.
  As they rode home along the bridle path that snakes through the valley, Eify and Aumara were lost in thought. They knew they were in a terrible situation, and they didn't know how they were going to get out of it. They didn’t see the dark rider close in from the adjoining path, nor the archers in the trees up ahead.

  As they rode home along the bridle path that snakes through the valley, Eify and Aumara were lost in thought. They knew they were in a terrible situation, and they didn't know how they were going to get out of it. They didn’t see the dark rider close in from the adjoining path, nor the archers in the trees up ahead. What happened next?
  Write a scenario where they suddenly become aware of the hidden soldiers but are relieved to see they are friends. 
  As Eify and Aumara rode home along the bridle path that snakes through the valley, they were lost in thought, unaware of the danger that lurked ahead. Suddenly, they heard the sound of hoofbeats approaching from the adjoining path. Eify's heart raced as he turned to see a dark rider closing in on them.
  Just as they were about to panic, they realized that the rider was a friend - their neighbor, Taren, who was accompanied by a group of archers from the village. Eify and Aumara breathed a sigh of relief as Taren explained that he had been sent to find them and bring them back to the safety of the village.
  "We've been worried sick about you two," Taren said as he dismounted from his horse. "There have been rumors of bandits and other dangers in these parts, and we didn't want you to be caught off guard."
  Eify and Aumara thanked Taren and the archers for their concern and protection, and they rode back to the village together, grateful for the timely intervention of their friends.
  Taren brings news that Aumaras father is sick and they must find a witch doctor immediately. This would mean taking a detour past Dark Rock Culverin, so named after the battle fought there leaving hundreds of cannons strewn across the plan.

  Taren: Eify, Aumara, I'm sorry to bring more bad news, but I just received word that there is an emergency at the Inn. There is an imminent threat from bandits and the Innkeeper is relying on your help.
  Eify: Damn. We can't leave the Inn unprotected. Aumara, you go and find the witch doctor. I'll go and deal with the threat at the Inn.
  Aumara: Are you sure, Eify? It's not safe for you to go alone.
  Eify: I know, but I don't have a choice. The Innkeeper is counting on us. You go and find the witch doctor. I'll meet you back here as soon as I can.
  Aumara: Once the threat is dispelled, albeit temporarily have word put out that help is needed at the Drunken Dragon.
  Eify opened his mouth to protest but was cut off 
  Aumara: All right, Eify. Be careful. I'll see what I can do to find the witch doctor and meet you back here as soon as I have any news. 
  Sensing that the financial burden of this request weighed on Eify, Aumara added ‘Don’t worry about the money, safety and health first’/
  Eify nodded.
  Aumara: Meet two days hence and then we can make flight with the witch doctor and help father. 
  With that they parted ways, Eify with Taren and two men, Aumara by herself, white horse belly and flank dark with mud.

  Eify and Taren rode their horses as fast as they could towards the Drunken Dragon, determined to protect their home from raiders. They had left Aumara to seek the help of the witchdoctor Jkaeri in Dark Rock Culverin, but they had no way of knowing what dangers she might be facing.
  As they approached the tavern, they could see that it was eerily quiet. No sounds of fighting or shouting could be heard. Eify and Taren exchanged a worried look, their sense of foreboding growing stronger.
  They dismounted their horses and cautiously approached the entrance of the Tavern. Taren pushed open the door, his hand on the hilt of his sword. Inside, the scene was chaotic. Tables and chairs were overturned, and the floor was covered in broken glass and spilled ale. But there was no sign of any raiders.
  Eify let out a low curse. "Where are they?" he muttered.
  Suddenly, a loud crash came from the back room. Eify and Taren looked at each other, then drew their swords and rushed towards the sound. As they burst into the room, they saw nothing but empty space.
  Eify swore again. "We've been tricked," he said. "There was never any threat here. We were meant to be away from the crossroads."
  Taren nodded, his face grim. "We have to go back and find Aumara. She might be in danger."
  The two friends quickly left the tavern and mounted their horses, racing back towards the crossroads. 
  Eify and Taren approached the crossroads cautiously, their eyes scanning the ground for any signs of their quarry. Taren pointed to a set of horse tracks that led off to the left.
  "Look, those tracks are fresh," he said. "And see how they're joined by others? I think we're on the right track."
  Eify nodded, her heart racing with excitement and a hint of fear. They followed the tracks with stealth, moving as quietly as possible through the underbrush.
  Eify and Taren stood over the evidence of the recent ambush, their eyes scanning the ground for any clues as to who could have attacked their friend, Aumara. The assassins had dismounted in the nearby woods, using the treeline to obscure their approach.
  The two friends knew they had to find out who was responsible for this attack. They followed the tracks, their footsteps sinking into the muddy ground as they made their way through the green yet barren lands.
  As they walked, the tension between them grew. They both knew that whoever was responsible for this attack was still out there, somewhere in these desolate marshes.
  The tracks led them to a clearing, where they found two of the assassins, lying dead on the ground. It was clear that they had been killed by someone, but who could have done this? Eify and Taren searched the area, but found no sign of the killer.
  They continued on, their eyes peeled for any sign of the remaining assassins. The tracks led them deeper into the marshes, the murky water swallowing their feet as they trudged forward.
  The air was heavy with the smell of decay, and the only sound was the squelching of their footsteps in the mud. It was a haunting, eerie place, and Eify and Taren couldn't shake the feeling that they were being watched.
  As they pressed on, they saw the tracks split off in two different directions. Eify and Taren looked at each other, unsure of which way to go.
  "We have to split up," Eify said, her voice barely above a whisper. "We'll cover more ground that way."
  Taren nodded, and the two friends set off in opposite directions, each following their own set of tracks.
  As they walked, the marshes seemed to close in around them, the thick brush and overgrown trees blocking out any sign of the outside world. Eify and Taren were completely alone, with only their determination to find the truth driving them forward.
  But as the hours passed, their hope began to fade. They had found no sign of the remaining assassins, and the tracks had long since disappeared into the muddy waters.
  Exhausted and disheartened, Eify and Taren made their way back to the clearing where they had found the dead assassins. They had failed in their mission, and they knew that Aumara would never be safe until the perpetrators were brought to justice.
  But they also knew that they couldn't give up. They would have to find a way to continue their search, no matter how difficult or dangerous it may be. For Aumara, and for all those who had fallen victim to the shadowy forces that lurked in these green yet barren lands.

  As they drew closer, they began to see more signs that they were on the right path. The tracks became more numerous, and they could see the occasional broken twig or crushed blade of grass.
  "We must be getting close," Eify whispered. "I can feel it."
  Taren nodded, his hand straying to the hilt of his sword. They continued to follow the tracks, their senses heightened as they crept closer to their quarry.
  Finally, they saw movement up ahead. A group of horses and riders emerged from the trees, led by a tall, regal woman with long, flowing hair.
  "Aumara," Eify whispered, a sense of awe and determination in her voice. "We've found her."
  Taren nodded, his grip on his sword tightening. They followed Aumara and her riders with stealth, ready to strike at a moment's notice. The tension was thick in the air as they approached the crossroads, unsure of what awaited them.
  Finally, in the distance, they saw a scene of struggle. It was hard to make out what was happening, but it was clear that Aumara was in trouble.
  Eify and Taren hesitated for a moment, wondering what to do. Then, Taren had an idea. "The trader!" he exclaimed. "He might know something about what's going on. We should go talk to him."
  Eify nodded, and the two friends set off towards the trader's camp. As they approached, they saw that the trader was involved in the struggle, fighting alongside Aumara.
  Together, Eify, Taren, and the trader were able to defeat the attackers and rescue Aumara. As they stumbled away from the scene, bruised and battered, they knew that they had narrowly avoided disaster.
  "We have to get out of here," Taren panted, his chest heaving. "We don't know who set us up or why, but we can't stay in one place for long."
  Eify nodded, his face grim. "We'll figure out what happened and make those responsible pay," he vowed.
  And with that, the four friends set off into the night, ready to face whatever dangers lay ahead.

  Eify and Tanem trudged through the wetland, the sun beating down on their backs as they searched for any sign of Aumara. They had seen the struggle, the telltale signs of a fight, but their friend had vanished into the swampy wilderness. They knew that two of the assassins were already dead, but one was still missing, and they feared that Aumara had fallen victim to the last remaining killer.
  Despite the discomfort of their makeshift camps at night, a small tarp stretched over their heads to provide some shelter from the elements, they pressed on. They were determined to find Aumara, or at least discover her fate.
  As they neared the mountains, they began to come across the remains of the assassins' camp. It was clear that they were on the right track. The evidence of the killers' presence was all around them, and they knew that they were getting closer to their quarry.
  Despite their determination, the search was not easy. The wetlands were treacherous, with hidden bogs and swamps that could swallow a person whole. Eify and Tanem had to be constantly on guard, their eyes and ears alert for any sign of danger.
  As the days passed, they grew more and more tense. They knew that the assassin was still out there, somewhere, and they feared that he might be tracking them as well. They kept their weapons close at hand, ready for any attack that might come.
  Finally, after what seemed like an eternity, they caught sight of the assassin. He was crouched behind a tree, his eyes fixed on them as they approached. Eify and Tanem drew their weapons, their hearts racing with fear and excitement.
  The assassin sprang from his hiding place, a snarl on his lips and a blade in his hand. Eify and Tanem met him head-on, their swords clashing in a shower of sparks. The fight was fierce and intense, the three of them locked in a deadly dance of steel.
  Eify and Tanem were skilled warriors, but the assassin was no slouch either. He fought with all the ferocity of a cornered animal, striking out at them with brutal efficiency. The battle raged on, each of them giving it their all, until at last the assassin stumbled and fell to the ground under a crushing blow from Eify.
  Eify and Tanem approached the fallen assassin cautiously, their swords still at the ready. He was wounded, his breathing labored, but they knew that they couldn't let their guard down just yet.
  "We have to take him alive," Eify said through gritted teeth. "He knows where Aumara is. We have to find out where she is and make sure she's safe."
  Tanem nodded, his face grim. They both knew that this wouldn't be easy. The assassin was a dangerous man, and he wouldn't give up his secrets easily.
  But they were determined to find Aumara, no matter what it took.
  Eify knelt down beside the assassin, his sword pointed at the man's chest. "Where is Aumara?" he demanded. "What have you done with her?"
  The assassin sneered up at him, his eyes cold and calculating. "I'll never tell you," he spat. "You might as well kill me now."
  Eify's grip tightened on his sword. "We're not going to kill you," he said, his voice low and menacing. "But we will do whatever it takes to find Aumara. So you better start talking, or things are going to get very unpleasant for you."
  The assassin looked at him for a moment, then let out a sigh. "Fine," he said. "I'll tell you where she is. But you're not going to like it."
  Eify leaned in closer, his ears perked up. "Tell us," he said. "Where is Aumara?"
  "She's in the mountains," the assassin said. "In the hands of Mili, Soul Butcher and his minions. They've been using her as bait to lure you out into the open."
  Eify and Tanem exchanged a glance, their hearts sinking. They had known that the stakes were high, but they had never expected this.
  "We have to go after her," Tanem said, his voice grim. "We can't let her fall into the hands of the The Butcher."
  Eify nodded, his determination renewed. "We'll rescue her," he said. "We'll get her out of there, no matter what it takes."
